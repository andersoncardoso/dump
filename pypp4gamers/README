This Project aims to be a different approach to teaching programming, using graphics and games.
This is NOT a game maker. Only a easier way for benginners to work with graphical features.

 
For testing the lib you can manipulate the path in the example itself or create a soft link: 
in  Ubuntu/Debian

	cd /usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages
	sudo ln -s /path-to-pypp4gamers/src/pypp4gamers pypp4gamers

	considering that you have checked you git repository in your home folder it will be something like:
	sudo ln -s ~/pypp4gamers/src/pypp4gamers/ pypp4gamers
	
in Mac OSX (snow leopard)
	cd /Library/Python/2.6/site-packages
	sudo ln -s /path-to-pypp4gamers/src/pypp4gamers pypp4gamers

	considering that you have checked you git repository in your home folder it will be something like:
	sudo ln -s ~/pypp4gamers/src/pypp4gamers/ pypp4gamers
	


try enter a python shell and import pypp4gamers
everything should be working

Fow windows you should Google and search the place where the modules stay, and how to create a link.
Go to the folder with the modules, make a soft link to the src folder in the your development src folder.
