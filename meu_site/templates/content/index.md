Hi my name is **Anderson Pierre Cardoso**, am I'm web developer from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

I'm currently the lead developer at [CIOPartner](http://www.ciopartner.com.br/), where we build web apps for management that are very desktop-like, we use:

* python (mostly django and tornado)
* html5 and css3
* and a lot of javascript (jquery mostly)

I study computer engineering at the Polytechnic School of the University of Sao Paulo.

I'm also a rugby player, a very curious person, passionate about programming and anything related to computing and technology.

I intent to put here a lot about programming, and a little about my life. I hope you enjoy (or no, whatever, I've built this for myself =P )
